Frontend (React.js):

AuthComponent.js: Handles user authentication (login, register, Google sign-in) with a modal interface.
Matches.js: New component that fetches and displays football matches.
App.js: Main component that renders the AuthComponent and Matches component.
config.js: Contains configuration variables like API URL and Google Client ID.
api.js: Axios instance for making API calls with authentication.
index.css: Contains Tailwind CSS imports and any custom styles.
tailwind.config.js: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS.

Backend (Node.js with Express.js):

server.js: Main entry point for the backend, sets up Express, middleware, and CORS.
routes/auth.js: Handles authentication routes (register, login, Google auth).
routes/matches.js: New route file that handles fetching matches from the database.
models/User.js: Mongoose schema for the User model.
models/Match.js: New Mongoose schema for the Match model.

Key Features Implemented:

User Authentication:

User Registration: Users can register with a username, email, password, and country.
User Login: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
Google Sign-In: Users can sign in using their Google accounts.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens are used for maintaining user sessions.


Match Display:

Fetch Matches: Users can view matches for a specific date or fetch all matches.
Date Navigation: Users can navigate between days to view different matches.
Match Grouping: Matches are grouped and displayed by competition.
Match Status: Different match statuses (TIMED, IN_PLAY, FINISHED, etc.) are handled and displayed appropriately.
Match Details: Each match shows team names, crests, and current score or scheduled time.


UI/UX Improvements:

Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly, modern UI.
Interactive Elements: Buttons for date navigation and fetching all matches.



Database:

MongoDB: Used for storing user information and match data.

Deployment:

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel
Backend: Deployed on Render

Match Display Flow:

User lands on the page, and matches for the current date are fetched and displayed.
User can navigate to previous or next day using provided buttons.
Matches are grouped by competition and displayed with relevant information.
Match status is rendered differently based on whether the match is scheduled, in progress, or finished.
User can fetch all matches regardless of date using the "Fetch All Matches" button.

Next Steps:

Implement match prediction functionality:

Allow users to make predictions for upcoming matches
Store user predictions in the database


Implement user profile:

Add a profile page where users can view and edit their information
Show user's prediction history and accuracy


Implement AI predictions:

Integrate an AI model or algorithm for match predictions
Compare AI predictions with user predictions


Create a leaderboard:

Rank users based on their prediction accuracy
Display top predictors


Add admin functionality:

Create an admin panel for managing matches and users
Allow admins to input match results and calculate prediction accuracy


Enhance UI/UX:

Add animations for smoother transitions
Implement dark mode toggle
Add form validation with error messages


Implement real-time updates:

Use WebSockets or server-sent events to update match scores and predictions in real-time


Add social features:

Allow users to follow other predictors
Implement a commenting system for matches


Optimize performance:

Implement lazy loading for components
Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data


Enhance security:

Implement rate limiting on the backend
Add two-factor authentication option for users
