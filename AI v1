Project Overview:
"We Know Better" is a web application for football (soccer) match predictions. It allows users to view upcoming matches, make predictions, and tracks the accuracy of both user (fans) and AI predictions.

Frontend (React.js):

AuthComponent.js: Handles user authentication (login, register, Google sign-in).
App.js: Main component that renders the AuthComponent.
config.js: Contains configuration variables like API URL.
api.js: Axios instance for making API calls with authentication.

Backend (Node.js with Express.js):

server.js: Main entry point for the backend, sets up Express and middleware.
routes/auth.js: Handles authentication routes (register, login, Google auth).
models/User.js: Mongoose schema for the User model.

Key Features Implemented:

User Registration: Users can register with a username, email, password, and country.
User Login: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
Google Sign-In: Users can sign in using their Google accounts.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens are used for maintaining user sessions.
CORS Configuration: Allows the frontend to communicate with the backend.

Database:

MongoDB: Used for storing user information.

Deployment:

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel
Backend: Deployed on Render

Next Steps:

Implement match prediction functionality:

Create a model for football matches
Add routes for fetching upcoming matches
Create a component for displaying matches and allowing predictions


Implement user profile:

Add a profile page where users can view and edit their information
Show user's prediction history and accuracy


Implement AI predictions:

Integrate an AI model or algorithm for match predictions
Compare AI predictions with user predictions


Create a leaderboard:

Rank users based on their prediction accuracy
Display top predictors


Add admin functionality:

Create an admin panel for managing matches and users
Allow admins to input match results and calculate prediction accuracy


Enhance UI/UX:

Improve the overall design and user experience
Add responsive design for mobile devices


Implement real-time updates:

Use WebSockets or server-sent events to update match scores and predictions in real-time


Add social features:

Allow users to follow other predictors
Implement a commenting system for matches



To continue building this project:

Focus on implementing one feature at a time.
Create new components in the frontend for each major feature (e.g., MatchList, Prediction, Leaderboard).
Add corresponding routes and controllers in the backend to handle new features.
Update the database schema as needed to support new features.
Regularly test your application and fix any bugs or issues that arise.
Consider adding unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application.

Remember to keep your authentication mechanism (JWT) consistent across new features and protect routes that require authentication in the backend.
